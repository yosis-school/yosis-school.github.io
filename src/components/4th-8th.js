        You have options! Look into synagogue and temple religious schools to see what programs are best for your child(ren). Our classes meet weekdays, 4:30-5:20 for Hebrew and 5:30-6:20 for Torah. I recommend taking both subjects together. Learning is relaxed and unpressured; after all, itâ€™s at the end of a long day.
