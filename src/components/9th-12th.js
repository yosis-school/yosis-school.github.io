          <li><strong>The 7 Best Stories in the T'nach</strong> (1 or 2 semesters, English and Hebrew texts) The Bible contains many genres, but the narratives are arguably the best
loved. Our deep dive into biblical narratives, in Hebrew and/or English, will engage and challenge students to
combine skills in literature, history, archeology, and theology, as each one thinks openly and critically about
his/her/their own vision of our greatest text.</li>
          <li><strong>Violence in Jewish Law & Thought</strong> (2 semesters: fall - Jewish Law, spring - Jewish Thought) I feel safe with almost everyone I’ve ever met, so why is the world
such a violent place? And how do we, as individuals and members of a community/society, function in such a
challenging world? In the first semester, we will solve a New Jersey gangland mystery by looking into one of
our oldest law books, the M’chilta, for a classic Jewish response to violence. In the second, ancient midrashim
will shine new light on questions of the origins of violence, the nature of humankind, and the uniquely Jewish
obligations in today's world.</li>
          <li><strong>Judaism, Christianity, and Islam: 2 Religions and 1 People</strong> (1 semester) Christianity and Islam are two great religions.
The Jewish people are blessed with rich religious content, but we are not essentially a religion. What are we,
why, how, and what difference does it make?</li>
          <li><strong>Five Paths to Jewish Spirituality</strong> (1 or 2 semesters) The ages 14-25 are the time when we each create our own philosophy of
life and our own way of being Jewish. Some say there is only one right way. They’re wrong. Five paths, and
many more.</li>
          <li><strong>What's Happening in Israel (and America)?— Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow</strong> (1 or 2 semesters) This course will be
created week-t0-week and day-t0-day, but will draw also from the history and sociology of contemporary
American and Israeli Jewry to bring content and open-mindedness to some of the hardest questions.</li>
          <li><strong>Peoplehood and Hatred: What Is Antisemitism and Why Us?</strong> (1 semester) For decades I have never found it
          necessary to teach about antisemitism, its theory and practice. Today, sadly, is different.</li>
          <li><strong>The Singing People: Lots of Songs and What They Tell Us About Jews in Israel and America</strong> (1-2 semesters) The story of Jews in America and Israel told through song. From the Yiddish theater and
ḥalutzim (Israeli pioneers) through Jewish tin pan alley and mizraḥi rock and up to Israeli rap,
Leonard Cohen, Matisyahu, and beyond.</li>
